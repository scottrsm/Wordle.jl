It does this by taking each word and rearranging the letters in alphabetical order. It then sorts this list of new \"words\" lexically, while keeping the associated weights. This list of words is looped over, forming grouping \"words\" with corresponding associated  weight equal to the sum of all proper words that it \"contains\".\n\nFor instance, the words: \"ether\", \"there\", and \"three\" each get translated to the grouping string: \"eehrt\". Next, the grouping strings like \"eehrt\" are sorted. In the case of the string \"eehrt\", it occurs three times for the three associated words. The weights of the three occurrences is also kept. We loop over these grouping strings and add up the associated weights. Finally, we find the grouping string with the most weight and look for the first match in the vector, words, that belongs to this grouping string. Since words is ordered by weight, we get the word that has the highest weight of the words in its associated grouping string.\n\nType Constraints\n\nT <: AbstractString\n\nArguments\n\nwords::AbstractVector{T}       : The remaining pool of words to guess from.\nwts  ::AbstractVector{Float64} : The usage frequency of the associated words in the vector, words. \n\nInput Contract\n\nwords == words[sortperm(wts, rev=true)] quad (Words are sorted from highest to lowest by word usage.)\n\nReturn\n\nThe index of a \"best\" guess in the user supplied vector of words.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Index","page":"Wordle.jl Documentation","title":"Index","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Wordle.jl Documentation","title":"Wordle.jl Documentation","text":"","category":"page"}]
